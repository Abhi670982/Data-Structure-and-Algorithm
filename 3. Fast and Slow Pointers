The fast and slow pointer technique uses two pointers moving at different speeds through a data structure (usually a linked list or array) to solve problems efficiently in O(n) time and O(1) space.
🧠 Basic Idea
Slow pointer (slow) → moves 1 step at a time
Fast pointer (fast) → moves 2 steps at a time
Because of the speed difference, we can detect patterns like:
loops (cycles)
middle elements
intersections

🚀 Why is it Powerful?
✅ Avoids extra memory (no hash sets)
✅ Faster than brute force
✅ Very common in LeetCode + interviews

🐢🐇 Famous Name
This technique is also called Floyd’s Cycle Detection Algorithm
Slow = Tortoise 🐢
Fast = Hare 🐇


LeeCode Easy Question : 
Question : 876           Middle Of The LinkedList                                                                                                         04|01|2026

solution:

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head;

        while(fast!=nullptr && fast->next!=nullptr){
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }
        return slow;
    }
};
